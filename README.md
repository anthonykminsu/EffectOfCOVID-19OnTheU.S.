# Lab04: Mapping COVID-19

## Overview
This lab showcases two interactive web maps using Mapbox GL JS. The first map visualizes COVID-19 case rates in Washington counties while the other displays population density in the U.S. states.

## Maps
1. **COVID-19 Case Rates Map (`index.html`)**: This map displays the cumulative COVID-19 case rates per 10,000 people in each county. Data was collected in Washington state and was last updated in October 25th, 2021.

2. **Population Density Map (`pop_density.html`)**: This map illustrates the population density (people per square mile) in each U.S. state.

## Features
- Interactive hover effects to display specific information tailored to the region.
- Color-coded regions based on data metrics (red and orange).
- Switch button to toggle between the COVID-19 Case Rates map and the Population Density map.

## Data
- **Sources**: The COVID-19 data was sourced from The New York Times and Washington State Department of Health. Population estimates are from the Washington State Office of Financial Management and U.S. Census Bureau.
- **Libraries Used**: Mapbox GL JS for map rendering and interactivity.
